Instruction Guide 

Definition of the code root:

This program classifies the marble images using LBP and Histogram Features.

The intelligent classifier is Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).

To evaluate the main classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are also tested.

After the feature extraction above listed files are gathered:

mix4s-histogram.arff
mix4s-lbp.arff
mix4s-HistLBP.arff

Those files include the features of the marble images whose class labels are ' keivan',' onyx',' rossolevanto' and ' siyah'

The classifier code design files are listed as follows:

elmiteratif.java
svmcapraz.java
ysaiteratif.java
j48iteratif.java
